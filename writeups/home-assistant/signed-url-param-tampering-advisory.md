# Introduction

This write-up describes a vulnerability found in [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/), a popular open source home automation software. The vulnerability was found to affect versions before 2023.3.6 where a patch is introduced.

# Overview

In the [HTTP integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/http), requests can be authenticated with either a bearer token in the Authorization header, or with a signature (for GET requests) in the query string. A vulnerability was found in the signature validation function which allowed an attacker to tamper with a request’s query parameters to reuse a valid signature that would authenticate a request under a different set of query parameters

# Description

The implementation of the auth middleware is [here](https://github.com/home-assistant/core/blob/96225bb287cabd52791300c21ce06a70886f8f3b/homeassistant/components/http/auth.py#L203-L235):

```py
    @middleware
    async def auth_middleware(
        request: Request, handler: Callable[[Request], Awaitable[StreamResponse]]
    ) -> StreamResponse:
        """Authenticate as middleware."""
        authenticated = False

        if hdrs.AUTHORIZATION in request.headers and await async_validate_auth_header(
            request
        ):
            authenticated = True
            auth_type = "bearer token"

        # We first start with a string check to avoid parsing query params
        # for every request.
        elif (
            request.method == "GET"
            and SIGN_QUERY_PARAM in request.query_string
            and await async_validate_signed_request(request)
        ):
            authenticated = True
            auth_type = "signed request"

        if authenticated:
            _LOGGER.debug(
                "Authenticated %s for %s using %s",
                request.remote,
                request.path,
                auth_type,
            )

        request[KEY_AUTHENTICATED] = authenticated
        return await handler(request)
```

As seen in the `elif` block, for GET requests, it is possible to authenticate the request if a signature is present in the query string. The signature validation is performed in the [`async_validate_signed_request`](https://github.com/home-assistant/core/blob/96225bb287cabd52791300c21ce06a70886f8f3b/homeassistant/components/http/auth.py#L169-L201) method:

```py
    async def async_validate_signed_request(request: Request) -> bool:
        """Validate a signed request."""
        if (secret := hass.data.get(DATA_SIGN_SECRET)) is None:
            return False

        if (signature := request.query.get(SIGN_QUERY_PARAM)) is None:
            return False

        try:
            claims = jwt.decode(
                signature, secret, algorithms=["HS256"], options={"verify_iss": False}
            )
        except jwt.InvalidTokenError:
            return False

        if claims["path"] != request.path:
            return False

        params = dict(sorted(request.query.items()))
        del params[SIGN_QUERY_PARAM]
        for param in SAFE_QUERY_PARAMS:
            params.pop(param, None)
        if claims["params"] != params:
            return False

        refresh_token = await hass.auth.async_get_refresh_token(claims["iss"])

        if refresh_token is None:
            return False

        request[KEY_HASS_USER] = refresh_token.user
        request[KEY_HASS_REFRESH_TOKEN_ID] = refresh_token.id
        return True
```

A vulnerability exists here in the validation of the query params. The `claims["params"]` object provided in the signature body is checked against `dict(sorted(request.query.items()))` which is derived from the current request's query parameters.

Here, `request` is an aiohttp `Request` object, and `request.query` is a `MultiDictProxy` containing the query parameters. The `.items` method returns a list of tuples containing the `(key, value)` pairs corresponding to each query parameter. Importantly, aiohttp supports multiple query parameters with the same name through this, so providing a query string such as `x=1&x=2` will result in the `request.query.items()` being `[('x', '1'), ('x', '2')]`. Because of the way this is handled in the signature validation, when multiple values are specified, some of them will be ignored. Specifically, when it is used to construct the `dict` object, the "largest" (by string comparison) value will be taken and the "smaller" values will be ignored.

However, when using query parameters in request handlers via the `request.query.get(param_key)` method, the _first_ parameter that appears in the query string is taken. This means the parameter being validated and the parameter actually used by a handler may differ.

As an example, suppose some functionality signs the path `/test?id=7` and we obtain the signature for this path. In this case, `claims["params"]` will be `{ "id": 7 }`. If we attempt to access the path `/test?id=6&id=7` using the same signature, it will be authorised since `dict(sorted(request.query.items())) == { "id": 7 }`, but the handler for that path will use `id=6` (if the `id` is obtained via a call to `request.query.get("id")`).

# Proof of Concept

The following test case (in `tests/components/http/test_auth.py`) can be run to verify the issue:

```py
@pytest.mark.parametrize(
    ("base_url", "test_url", "chosen_param_value"),
    [
        ("/test?id=7", "/test?id=6&id=7", "6"),
    ],
)
async def test_auth_access_signed_path_with_multiple_query_param_tamper(
    hass: HomeAssistant,
    app,
    aiohttp_client: ClientSessionGenerator,
    hass_access_token: str,
    base_url: str,
    test_url: str,
    chosen_param_value: str,
) -> None:
    """Test access with signed url and query params that have been tampered with using repeated parameters."""
    async def mock_handler(request):
        """Return if request was authenticated."""
        if not request[KEY_AUTHENTICATED]:
            raise HTTPUnauthorized

        user = request.get("hass_user")
        user_id = user.id if user else None

        assert request.query.get('id') == chosen_param_value
        return web.json_response(data={"user_id": user_id})

    app.router.add_get("/test", mock_handler)
    await async_setup_auth(hass, app)
    client = await aiohttp_client(app)

    refresh_token = await hass.auth.async_validate_access_token(hass_access_token)

    signed_path = async_sign_path(
        hass, base_url, timedelta(seconds=5), refresh_token_id=refresh_token.id
    )
    url = yarl.URL(signed_path)
    token = url.query.get(SIGN_QUERY_PARAM)

    req = await client.get(f"{test_url}&{SIGN_QUERY_PARAM}={token}")
    assert req.status == HTTPStatus.UNAUTHORIZED
```

With the implementation of the signature validation as of Home Assistant Core 2023.3.5, this test will fail as the final assertion will not hold due to the request being improperly authorised.

# Impact

There were no cases identified which used query parameters in signed urls. Furthermore, to exploit this issue, an attacker would need to obtain a signed URL in the first place, which may significantly decrease the likelihood.

This may potentially be an issue if in the future components or integrations are implemented which depend on this feature and use query parameters for sensitive fields (such as IDs or file paths).
